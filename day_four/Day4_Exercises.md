1. Create a class that represents a bucket

- For example, it can have three attributes:
	
	- name
	
	- max volume
	
	- current volume





2. Add a function that uses the class created in the previous exercise so you can transfer volume from one bucket to another but not exceede the  max volume of a bucket.

3. Create a class that represents a Circle. The Circle's initialization function should only require the radius but it should also set the area and permeter of the circle. 

Include two methods: one to calculate the area of the circle and one to calculate the perimeter of the circle.
