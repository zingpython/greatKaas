1. Create a class that represents a bucket

- For example, it can have three attributes:
	
	- name
	
	- max volume
	
	- current volume





2. Add a function that uses the class created in the previous exercise so you can transfer volume from one bucket to another but not exceede the  max volume of a bucket.

3. Create a class that represents a Circle. The Circle's initialization function should only require the radius but it should also set the area and permeter of the circle. 

Include two methods: one to calculate the area of the circle and one to calculate the perimeter of the circle.

4. Lets simulate a space ship. We can assume that our spaceship is traveling through space towards a specific point in space that is represented with an X and Y coordinate. It is traveling at a specific velocity. Create a class that can contain the information about the spaceship. The space ship needs to be able to hold the following properties:

		Its current X and Y position

		The target's X and Y position

		Its current Speed

		And its name.

In addition write a function that advanced it towards the target by its speed, and a function that calculates how many times it needs to move its speed before it reaches its target.
